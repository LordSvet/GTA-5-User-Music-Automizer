# GTA-5-User-Music-Automizer
Python script to convert and download youtube songs directly into the GTA 5 User Music folder



HOW TO USE:

    1. Open the script with any text editor(e.g. Notepad)
    2. Change the outputPath and linksPath variables:
        - outputPath should be your path to your User Music folder(on Windows that's usually on Documents/Rockstar Games/GTA V/User Music)
        - linksPath should be the path to your file where you have your links
        It can be a regular .txt file with a new link every line. Do not put more than one link on one line
    DISCLAIMER: DO NOT REMOVE THE 'r' in front of the path as if it is not a raw string it might throw an error because of the '\' in the path
    
    3. After that is done and you have your links in your text file you can run the script through your command-line. Example with cmd on windows:
    Open CMD and navigate to the directory where your script is and run the following command:
    
                                        python script.py

    And that's all! Enjoy some self radio tunes.

    Disclaimer 2: Keep in mind you need python installed for this to work.
